/**
 * iTantra's single Activity.

 * The Activity attaches to a **cached** Flutter engine and refuses to destroy
 * it with the host. That is what makes "SOS reaches a phone whose app is
 * closed" work: when the user swipes iTantra off the recents list, the Activity
 * dies but the Dart isolate keeps running, so the BLE / Wi-Fi Direct mesh stays
 * up. [SosService] holds the process at foreground priority so Android does not
 * reclaim it in the meantime.
 *
 * All native channels are registered on the engine in
 * [iTantraChannels.register], before the Dart entrypoint starts, so they are
 * also available when no Activity is attached.
