# iTantra — Complete Feature & Section Reference

Every screen section, every feature, how it works, where it lives in the code,
and what is honestly *not* shipped. Written from the source in `lib/` and
`android/`, not from the README, so where the two disagree this document is
right (see §13).

## 0. Snapshot

| | |
|---|---|
| Name | iTantra (ई-तंत्र) — Indian Multilingual Neural Transceiver |
| Platform | Android (Flutter 3.x, Dart SDK `^3.11.4`) |
| Version | `0.2.0+1` |
| Build | Split release APK: `arm64-v8a` 60.6 MB · `armeabi-v7a` 45.9 MB |
| Connectivity | BLE GATT mesh + Wi-Fi Direct (Wi-Fi P2P), concurrently |
| Cloud dependency | **None at runtime.** Internet is used once, optionally, to download speech models |
| Regulated SDKs | None on the recognition or synthesis path (open-source only) |
| Languages | 23 registered (22 scheduled + English) |
| Tests | 78 passing across 5 suites · `flutter analyze` clean |

**One-sentence summary:** speech is recognised on the phone, sent as ~40–80
bytes of text over an ad-hoc radio link, and re-synthesised as speech on the
receiving phone — so a voice conversation survives with no network at all.

---

## 1. The core loop

```
speaker → mic → Silero VAD → IndicConformer INT8 STT → text
      → iBFS-v1 encode (14 B overhead) → BLE / Wi-Fi Direct
      → iBFS-v1 decode + CRC → on-device TTS → speaker
```

| Stage | Implementation | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Capture | `record` package, 16 kHz mono PCM | `lib/ml/stt_engine.dart` |
| VAD | Silero VAD v4 ONNX (bundled asset, 2.3 MB) | `assets/models/vad/silero_vad.onnx` |
| STT | AI4Bharat IndicConformer, INT8 ONNX via sherpa-onnx FFI | `lib/ml/stt_engine.dart` |
| Encode | iBFS-v1 binary frame | `lib/ml/ibfs.dart` |
| Fragmentation | 5-byte chunk envelope for BLE MTU limits | `lib/net/fragmentation.dart` |
| Transport | BLE GATT + Wi-Fi Direct, aggregated and deduplicated | `lib/net/mesh_transport.dart` |
| Decode | Magic + CRC-16-CCITT validation, then payload walk | `lib/ml/ibfs.dart` |
| TTS | sherpa-onnx VITS (MMS) neural voice, platform TTS fallback | `lib/ml/tts_engine.dart` |

**Why text, not audio:** 3 s of 16 kHz/16-bit audio is ~96 KB. The same
sentence as text is ~40–80 bytes — a ~99.9 % reduction — and the listener still
hears a voice.

---

## 2. Home screen — section by section (top to bottom)

`lib/ui/home_screen.dart`. This is the only operating surface; everything else
is one tap away.

| # | Section | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | **App bar** | Title with tower glyph, queue badge, link badge, settings button, master transceiver switch |
| 2.2 | **Queue badge** | `📤 N` — count of undelivered store-and-forward messages (visible only when N > 0) |
| 2.3 | **Link badge** | Live radio pill: green `N peers` · saffron `searching`/`listening` · grey `offline`. Tooltip carries the per-radio detail string |
| 2.4 | **Transceiver switch** | Master on/off. Turning it on also triggers a model pre-download for the current sender language |
| 2.5 | **Settings bar** | `Speak` language → `Listen` language, plus the GPS stamping toggle |
| 2.6 | **Mode / role bar** | One-tap chip toggling Walkie-Talkie ⇄ Phone (hands-free), a green `LISTENING` chip while hands-free runs, and a role chip (Transceiver / STT only / TTS only) that jumps to Settings |
| 2.7 | **Link hint** | One actionable sentence shown only while a radio is up but no peer has been found — the "searching forever" state explained instead of silently spinning |
| 2.8 | **Model download banner** | Indeterminate + determinate progress bar for the STT model download |
| 2.9 | **Pipeline strip** | Five live stages — STT → Encode → TX → Decode → TTS — with per-stage millisecond timings from the last packet |
| 2.10 | **Transcription preview** | The interim transcript as it is recognised, with "Release or tap to send" |
| 2.11 | **Status banner** | Single-line feedback (dismissible) for non-fatal events; suppressed while transmitting |
| 2.12 | **Talk area** | The centre control: PTT button, hands-free panel, or a receiver-only placeholder depending on mode and role |
| 2.13 | **Download models button** | Appears only when the sender language has no STT model on the device |
| 2.14 | **Model status line** | Green when the sender's speech model is ready, muted otherwise |
| 2.15 | **Voice download banner / status** | Same treatment for the neural TTS voice, with a platform-synthesizer fallback note |
| 2.16 | **Typed-text fallback** | Text field + send action. Deliberately independent of the STT model, so a phone with no speech model can still transmit |
| 2.17 | **SOS button + emergency readiness** | The SOS trigger, next to three readiness chips (Standby · DND · Battery) that are green when ready and tappable to fix when not |
| 2.18 | **Packet log** | Reverse-chronological log of every sent and received packet |
| 2.19 | **Alarm overlay** | Full-screen, non-dismissible emergency/alarm overlay layered above everything (§4.3) |

### 2.3 / 2.7 The link badge and link hint are a deliberate fix

An earlier build showed a two-state pill that read **"offline"** whenever no peer
had been *found yet*, even with both radios running. A working app looked
broken. `LinkStats` (`lib/net/mesh_transport.dart`) now distinguishes three
states and exposes `label`, `detail`, `failureHint` and `searchHint` so the UI
can say *what to check* instead of lying.

### 2.13 / 2.16 Voice needs a model; typing does not

If the speech model is missing, the PTT path degrades to a
`🎙️ [Voice note]` placeholder rather than failing silently, and the typed-text
path keeps working with no ML dependency at all.

---

## 3. Settings screen — section by section

`lib/ui/settings_screen.dart`. All values persist through `AppSettings`
(`shared_preferences`) and survive a restart — including a restart by the OS
while the app runs as a background standby service.

| Section | Contents |
|---|---|
| **Identity** | Username, max 8 characters, transmitted in every packet. Live preview of how receivers will see it: `[Vikas] …` |
| **Operation mode** | `Walkie-Talkie (PTT)` vs `Phone (hands-free)`, with an explanation of the exact VAD behaviour for the selected mode |
| **Device role** | `Transceiver` · `STT (sender)` · `TTS (receiver)`, with a per-role explainer. This is the pairing setup for a two-phone evaluation |
| **Audio** | Speech-rate slider, 0.5×–1.5× (20 divisions), applied to both the neural and platform voices |
| **Emergency** | Hardware SOS trigger switch, blood group, pre-existing conditions, emergency contact — the last three are appended to every SOS you send. Live status chips for Standby / DND / Battery exemption |
| **Storage & rescue log** | `Clear cached audio & message log` and `Delete downloaded speech models` (guarded by a confirmation dialog that spells out the offline consequence) |

### 3.1 Operation mode — what actually changes

| Mode | Mic behaviour | Sentence boundary |
|---|---|---|
| **Walkie-Talkie** | Opens on PTT press. A quick tap latches recording until the next tap | `kPttSilenceSeconds = 0.45 s` |
| **Phone (hands-free)** | Stays open continuously; each finished sentence is emitted as a final result and sent with no button press | `kHandsFreeSilenceSeconds = 3.0 s` — the "strictly 3.0 seconds of silence" boundary |

In hands-free mode inbound audio is muted while the phone's own voice plays, so
the app never transcribes and re-transmits its own output — the classic
walkie-talkie feedback loop.

### 3.2 Device role — why it exists

The evaluation asks for two phones configured as a minimal sender/receiver
pair. `STT (sender)` disables playback, `TTS (receiver)` disables the
microphone and shows an explicit receiver-only placeholder instead of a dead
button. `Transceiver` is the real deployment mode.

---

## 4. Modals, overlays and the talk area

| # | Component | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | **PTT button** (`widgets/ptt_button.dart`) | Hold to talk, release to send; tap to latch. Pulse animation while recording; distinct processing state |
| 4.2 | **Hands-free panel** | Shown instead of PTT in phone mode: live interim text, a paused indicator, and a stop control |
| 4.3 | **Alarm overlay** (`widgets/alarm_overlay.dart`) | Full-screen, pulsing red, **non-dismissible**, keeps the screen awake, auto-clears. Label is `SOS` or `EMERGENCY` depending on how it was raised. Shows the sender's name and message |
| 4.4 | **SOS confirm dialog** (`widgets/sos_button.dart`) | Sending an SOS is irreversible and reaches every device in range, so a single tap is not enough. A 3-second auto-cancelling countdown sheet prevents pocket triggers without slowing a real emergency. Accepts an optional note |
| 4.5 | **Clear-cache dialog** | Two-step confirmation before deleting speech models, stating the exact offline consequence |
| 4.6 | **Role placeholder** | In receiver-only role, an explicit "TTS MODE — RECEIVER ONLY" panel rather than a button that does nothing |

### 4.3 Alarm durations

| Raised by | Window |
|---|---|
| Distress keyword in a received message | `kEmergencyAlertSeconds = 5 s` |
| Explicit SOS packet | `kSosAlertSeconds = 20 s` |

A keyword match is a signal; an explicit SOS means somebody is asking for help,
so it holds the screen far longer.

## 5. Feature catalogue

### 5.1 Speech in — recognition

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Offline STT** | AI4Bharat IndicConformer (NeMo CTC), INT8 ONNX, via sherpa-onnx FFI — no network, no Play Services |
| **Silero VAD** | Bundled, trims silence and defines sentence boundaries; the reason a 3-minute recording does not become one 3-minute transcription |
| **Live interim transcript** | Text appears character-by-character on screen *while* the user speaks |
| **RTF instrumentation** | Real-time factor = STT ms / audio ms. Below 1.0 means transcription ran faster than real time |
| **Utterance flush on release** | VAD only emits a segment after trailing silence, so `stop()` flushes whatever the VAD still holds — a short utterance spoken right before release is not lost |
| **Generation guard** | A `stop()` arriving before an async `start()` completes aborts the stale start, so a recorder is never leaked |
| **Bounded session buffer** | ~30 s of retained audio (`16 000 × 30` samples) — hands-free mode can run for hours without unbounded growth |
| **Per-language tokenizer** | Each language maps to its own tokens/model pair, which is the single biggest WER lever |
| **Model pre-download** | `predownloadModels()` warms the active language so the first transmission is not cold |

**Model availability is limited by what upstream publishes** — see §9.

### 5.2 Speech out — synthesis

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Neural TTS** | sherpa-onnx VITS (MMS) voices, ~114 MB per language, downloaded on first use |
| **Platform TTS fallback** | Any language without a published MMS voice still speaks through the phone's own synthesizer |
| **Speaks the sender's language** | The receive path loads and speaks `packet.language` — previously it downloaded the *receiver's* voice while speaking the sender's text, which was a real mismatch |
| **Emergency speech** | On an emergency packet the volume is forced to maximum, the stream is routed to alarm, DND is lifted when access is granted, and speech is nudged ~10 % faster |
| **Speech-rate control** | One user preference applied to both voices |
| **Auto-play on receive** | Same-language text is spoken aloud automatically; a cross-language packet degrades to text display with a note |

### 5.3 Protocol — iBFS-v1

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Binary framing** | 10-byte header + 2-byte CRC = **14 bytes overhead**, always |
| **Magic** | `0x49 0x54` ("IT") |
| **CRC-16-CCITT** | Polynomial `0x1021`, init `0xFFFF`, over header **and** payload. Corrupted frames are dropped, never played as garbage |
| **Packet types** | `0x1` PTT voice · `0x2` silent SOS · `0x3` ACK · `0x4` store-forward relay |
| **Priorities** | `0x0` routine · `0x1` high · `0xF` emergency |
| **Payload flags byte** | bit 7 GPS · bit 6 source language · bit 5 sender name · bit 4 extended language ID. Written unconditionally and *derived from the bytes actually present*, so encoder and decoder agree by construction |
| **Max payload** | 512 bytes |
| **23-language encoding** | The 4-bit header nibble addresses 15 IDs directly; `0xF` escapes to a payload byte for the rest. The original ten wire IDs are unchanged, so a 10-language build still interoperates byte-for-byte |
| **Sender name on the wire** | `[length][UTF-8]`, clamped to 8 characters **and** 64 bytes so a Devanagari name can never crowd out the message |
| **GPS stamping** | Optional float32 lat/lon pair, +8 bytes |
| **Unknown-language fallback** | An unrecognised language ID decodes as English rather than rejecting the frame — on a distress channel a readable message beats a dropped one |
| **Offset-safe decode** | Uses `ByteData.sublistView`, so a frame arriving as a view into a larger buffer (exactly what BLE reassembly produces) no longer decodes garbage |

### 5.4 Radios and networking

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **BLE GATT mesh** | Advertises a 128-bit service UUID plus the name `iTantra`; frames travel over a notify/write characteristic. Up to 4 peers, dedup by uint32 sequence ID |
| **Robust peer discovery** | A peer is accepted if **either** the service UUID matches **or** the advertised name matches — because some Android stacks return an empty service-UUID list for 128-bit UUIDs and a strict check silently rejected real phones |
| **Wi-Fi Direct (P2P)** | Negotiated group owner decided identically on both sides from the two device addresses; frames ride a length-prefixed TCP socket on port 8988. No hotspot, no router, no manual pairing |
| **Wi-Fi peer polling** | The native discover loop re-requests the peer list every 2 s, because some OEM stacks never broadcast `WIFI_P2P_PEERS_CHANGED_ACTION` |
| **Dual-radio concurrency** | Both radios carry the same frame at once; the receiver deduplicates so a message arriving over BLE *and* Wi-Fi is spoken exactly once |
| **Radio start policy** | BLE starts immediately (fast, low power). Wi-Fi Direct is held back 12 s while BLE searches, so the two radios do not fight over 2.4 GHz during setup — then joins in if BLE still has no peer |
| **Failure fallback** | If BLE cannot start at all, Wi-Fi Direct starts straight away, and vice versa |
| **Self-healing** | A 6-second health check restarts a dropped BLE radio and retries Wi-Fi Direct every 30 s |
| **Location-off handling** | `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` carries `neverForLocation`. With the system Location toggle off, Android returns **zero** BLE results and stalls Wi-Fi Direct discovery; GPS keeps its own explicit permission |
| **Zero-infrastructure** | No server, no client/host split, no pairing step, no hotspot. Every device transmits and receives on equal terms |

### 5.5 Emergency and SOS

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Manual SOS** | Confirmed, deliberate, reaches every device in range |
| **Hardware SOS trigger** | Hold a volume key — works while the app is running, including in the background, because capture is native and does not need widget focus |
| **Distress keyword detection** | Runs against the STT text, per language, with English keywords always added. A Hindi sentence containing "मदद" escalates even if the rest is Hindi |
| **Non-dismissible alarm** | Full-screen override, max volume, vibration, alarm audio stream, DND lifted when access is granted, auto-clear only |
| **Native alert layer** | The audible alert deliberately does **not** depend on the Flutter widget tree being mounted — the whole point is to reach a phone whose owner is not looking at the app |
| **Foreground standby service** | Keeps the process (and the Flutter isolate) alive after the app is swiped off recents, so SOS reception continues |
| **SOS medical telemetry** | Blood group, conditions and emergency contact are appended to your own SOS, so rescuers do not have to ask |
| **Readiness chips** | Standby · DND access · Battery exemption — the three OS-level settings that silently break SOS reception, surfaced as tappable chips |

### 5.6 Reliability and resilience

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Store-and-forward queue** | A frame that cannot be sent (no peer, no radio) is queued rather than lost, and flushed automatically when a link returns |
| **Queue survives restart** | The queue is persisted to `shared_preferences` and reloaded on launch |
| **Queue visibility** | The app-bar badge shows the pending count |
| **BLE fragmentation + reassembly** | iBFS frames up to 524 bytes travel as MTU-sized chunks with a `0xB5` magic envelope. Assemblies are keyed by `source/fragmentId`, so two peers using the same fragment ID cannot be spliced together |
| **Duplicate-chunk tolerance** | A chunk can arrive twice (BLE *and* Wi-Fi Direct, or a relay echo); re-storing a filled slot is a no-op instead of a false completion |
| **Crash-safe queue** | A corrupted persisted queue is discarded and rebuilt rather than crashing the launch |
| **Battery / thermal awareness** | `BatteryMonitor` exposes `isConstrained`, `shouldThrottle` and a status label so the ML workload can degrade gracefully |
| **Permission retry** | Denied permissions produce a clear snackbar listing what is missing, with a Retry action |

### 5.7 Settings and personalisation

Identity (username) · operation mode · device role · speech rate · GPS stamping ·
hardware SOS trigger · medical telemetry · cache and model management. All
persisted, and all owned by a single `AppSettings` instance — a deliberate fix,
because the earlier build kept the GPS toggle in the controller *and* in
settings, which is how preferences drift apart.

### 5.8 Instrumentation

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Pipeline strip** | Five-stage live visualisation with real per-stage timings |
| **Packet log** | Every sent/received packet with direction, language, sender name, priority, text, and timing |
| **Persistent log** | The log survives app restarts, so a whole drill can be reviewed afterwards |
| **Per-packet timings** | `STT ms`, `TX ms`, `TTS ms`, `ASR ms`, `RTF`, and bold `E2E ms` |
| **GPS in the log** | Coordinates rendered as monospace text, 4 decimal places |

## 6. Native Android layer

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `MainActivity.kt` | Activity + plugin registration |
| `iTantraChannels.kt` | Method-channel bridge for the SOS service (standby, alarm, DND, battery, hardware key) |
| `SosService.kt` | Foreground service, `stopWithTask=false`, `foregroundServiceType="connectedDevice"` |
| `EmergencyAlerts.kt` | Loud alarm on the alarm stream, vibration, full-screen notification |
| `WifiDirectPlugin.kt` | Wi-Fi P2P: discovery, group negotiation, TCP frame sockets, event channel |

**Channels:** `itantra/sos_service` · `itantra/wifidirect` · `itantra/wifidirect/events`
**Tuning constants:** port `8988` · discovery interval `10 s` · peer poll `2 s` · connect retry `8 s` · owner idle reset `25 s`

---

## 7. Permissions

| Permission | Used for |
|---|---|
| `RECORD_AUDIO` | Microphone → STT |
| `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` / `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` | GPS stamping |
| `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` (`neverForLocation`) · `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` · `BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE` | BLE mesh |
| `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES` | Wi-Fi Direct |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` (+ `_CONNECTED_DEVICE`) | Standby SOS reception |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | SOS / alarm notification |
| `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT` | Full-screen emergency alert |
| `ACCESS_NOTIFICATION_POLICY` | Lifting Do Not Disturb for an emergency |
| `INTERNET` | Model downloads only (never required at runtime) |
| Legacy `BLUETOOTH` / `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN` | Android ≤ 11 |

Requested at launch by `PermissionManager.requestAll()`; the mesh is activated
as soon as Bluetooth/location permission is granted.

---

## 8. Persistence map

| Data | Store |
|---|---|
| All user settings (identity, mode, role, rate, SOS, medical, GPS) | `shared_preferences` |
| Packet log | `shared_preferences` (survives restart) |
| Store-and-forward queue | `shared_preferences`, base64-encoded frames |
| STT models (per language) | App documents directory, ~167–189 MB each |
| TTS voices (per language) | App documents directory, ~114 MB each |
| Silero VAD | Bundled asset, 2.3 MB |

---

## 9. Language coverage — the honest table

23 languages are **registered** in the protocol registry
(`lib/ml/languages.dart`). What is actually available per language differs, and
this table is the accurate version.

| Group | Languages | STT model | Neural TTS |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fully usable offline after download | Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali, English | ✅ 9 published INT8 models | ✅ |
| Partial | Odia | ⚠️ tokens only — no model published upstream | ✅ (MMS `ory`) |
| Platform-voice only | Punjabi, Assamese, Maithili | ❌ none published | ✅ |
| Registered, awaiting upstream models | Urdu, Nepali, Konkani, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Dogri, Kashmiri, Bodo, Manipuri, Santali | ❌ | ❌ platform fallback |

**Consequence you must be able to state if asked:** a fresh offline install has
no speech model on disk, so the first run shows the `🎙️ [Voice note]` fallback.
One online session downloads the model (~189 MB for Hindi), after which that
language is fully offline forever.

---

## 10. Mapping to the evaluation criteria

| Criterion | Weight | What moves it in this build |
|---|---|---|
| **Accuracy** (WER, TTS naturalness) | 40 % | AI4Bharat IndicConformer INT8 per language with per-language tokenizer; live transcript with correction; distress detection as additional inference |
| **Efficiency** (size, RAM, CPU) | 20 % | Single-language resident policy, INT8 quantisation, VAD-gated capture, battery/thermal awareness |
| **Latency** (RTF, speech-to-speech) | 20 % | VAD trimming, model pre-warm on switch, 14-byte frame overhead, dual-radio concurrency |
| **Robustness / deployability** | implicit | CRC validation, fragmentation reassembly, cross-link dedup, store-and-forward, self-healing radios, language-mismatch fallback, three-state link reporting |

---

## 11. Test coverage

| Suite | Covers |
|---|---|
| `test/ibfs_codec_test.dart` | Frame round-trip, CRC validation, field extensions, distress detection |
| `test/fragmentation_test.dart` | Chunk splitting, reassembly, duplicate and out-of-order handling |
| `test/engines_test.dart` | STT/TTS engine behaviour and language wiring |
| `test/settings_map_test.dart` | Preference persistence and projections |
| `test/widget_test.dart` | Theme, language registry, widget smoke tests |

`flutter test` → **78/78 passing**. `flutter analyze` → **no issues**.
`./gradlew :app:compileReleaseKotlin` → clean.

## 13. Documented vs. shipped — where README and code disagree

The README describes the design intent and has not been updated alongside the
code. Current truth:

| README says | Actually shipped |
|---|---|
| "10 Indic languages" | 23 registered: 22 scheduled + English |
| "Model files are pre-downloaded at `assets/models/stt/`" | **Not bundled.** Only the VAD model is an asset. Speech models download on first use (that is what took the APK from a fat build to 60.6 MB) |
| "Cross-language translation" listed as a swap-in point | ML Kit translation is still in `pubspec.yaml` and `translation_engine.dart` exists, but it is **off the receive path**. Cross-language packets display as text with a note, and the receiver speaks the sender's language rather than translating |
| Offline map referenced in feature docs | `widgets/offline_map.dart` still exists but is **not referenced by any UI**. GPS coordinates are shown as text in the packet log |
| "Unit tests — 28 tests" | 78 tests |
| `Transport` current: LoopbackTransport | Real BLE + Wi-Fi Direct mesh |

None of these are deletions — the translation engine and map widget were kept
deliberately so either can be re-enabled.

---

## 14. Known limitations — say these before a judge finds them

1. **First-run download.** Speech models are not in the APK. Offline-first use
   requires one online session per language.
2. **Build compatibility.** A payload flags change made old and new builds
   wire-incompatible. **Both phones must run the same build.** This is why the
   old APKs are kept separately and never mixed.
3. **9 of 23 languages have a published STT model.** The registry is complete
   and forward-compatible; the upstream models are not all published.
4. **Not verified on hardware for the RF fixes.** The BLE name-fallback
   discovery, the `neverForLocation` flag and the Wi-Fi peer polling each target
   a real, identified cause, but a two-device field test is the only proof.
5. **Battery/thermal integration is partial.** `BatteryMonitor` exposes the
   policy and a `updateFromPlatform()` hook, but there is no native battery
   method channel wired yet — it assumes nominal.
6. **Multi-hop mesh relay is not implemented.** Store-and-forward queues for a
   peer that is out of range and delivers on reconnect; it does not yet route
   through an intermediate node, even though sequence-ID dedup already supports
   it.
7. **No encryption on the air.** iBFS provides integrity (CRC) but not
   confidentiality — a deliberate scope decision for a one-way distress beacon,
   not an oversight.
